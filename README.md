Hi there, I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics. I am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering, UK](https://society-rse.org/).

### What I do

👨‍💼: Develop and maintain R packages for modelling infectious disease outbreaks, including:
  * simulating and analyzing transmission chains,
  * estimating time-varying reproduction numbers,
  * nowcasting and forecasting disease incidence. 

🕐: Co-maintain the Carpentries course on [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson). 

### My day-to-day tasks

📦: Developing [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) as a successor of [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an 
R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains.

📦: Contributing to new features and enhancements of [EpiNow2](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2) and [epinowcast](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast).

📦: Contributing to developing other packages in the [Epiverse](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/).

🕵️‍♂️: Reviewing open source R code.

🕵️‍♂️: Peer reviewing manuscripts in Global Health, Epidemiology, and infectious disease modeling, and R software.

## Professional Development

📖: Slowly reading [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html).

🖥️: Slowly learning bayesian data analysis and [{rstan}](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) through 
the [Statistical Rethinking book](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus).

## Collaborations

⚙️: Are you developing (or have you developed) a method/model to improve outbreak analytics and would like to
make it reusable in the form of software? Please get in touch through any of my listed contacts below.

## Research

### Recently completed

1️⃣: Azam, J.M., Pang, X., Are, E.B., Pulliam, J.R. and Ferrari, M.J., 2023. [Modelling outbreak response impact in human vaccine-preventable diseases: A systematic review of differences in practices between collaboration types before COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100720). Epidemics, p.100720.

### Ongoing work

1️⃣: [Age-structured compartmental model](https://github.com/SACEMA/sa-polio-model) for 
estimating the timing of detection of polio-related acute flaccid paralysis in South 
Africa (generalizable to other settings).
    
2️⃣: [A surveillance pipeline](https://github.com/SACEMA/severity-monitoring) to detect 
changes in reported COVID-19 severity (case fatality, case hospitalization, and 
hospital fatality).
    
3️⃣: [A two-strain compartmental model](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/two_strain_orv_model) 
for studying the impact of the timing of the emergence of variants on control strategies.

### Broad research interests

1️⃣: Compartmental modelling of the impact of control measures against infectious diseases. 

2️⃣: (Bayesian) Models and methods for (near) real-time forecasting and nowcasting of infectious diseases.

## Teaching

I don't currently teach as part of my duties but I can teach the following topics quite comfortably:

1️⃣: R programming from the basics to advanced topics (R package development, object-oriented programming)

2️⃣: Git/GitHub from the basics to intermediate/advanced (merging and rebasing, cherry-picking, etc)

3️⃣: Reproducible data analysis workflows

4️⃣: Various topics in mathematical/statistical/dynamical modelling of infectious diseases

5️⃣: Various topics in data analysis

6️⃣: Thesis and journal article writing techniques

=======
Hi there :wave:, welcome!! 

I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, working on the [EpiVerse](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative funded by [data.org](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/). I am interested in developing software for scientific research, and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/). 

**Software Projects**

I am currently working to improve[bpmodels](https://github.com/sbfnk/bpmodels) in terms of user-friendiness: improved features, speed, and documentation. `bpmodels` is an R package that provides methods for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains generated from branching processes.

The package will soon be submitted to CRAN. Be on the lookout for this.


**Research interests**

I am a trained - PhD awarded - infectious disease modeller. I use computer simulations to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of infectious vaccine-preventable diseases. However, more broadly, I am interested in quantitative research that improves the health outcomes. 

To add to this, I like indulging in the science communication and science policy literature.
