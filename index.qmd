Hi there, I am a Research Software Engineer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics.

I am mainly interested in developing models and methods and
accompanying software to improve our understanding of how interventions impact disease
spread.

## What I do

üë®‚Äçüíº: Develop and maintain R packages for modelling infectious disease
outbreaks, including:

* Simulating and analysing transmission chains ([{epichains}](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/), [{bpmodels}](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/bpmodels/)),

* Estimating the time-varying reproduction number, growth rate, and real-time epidemiological counts ([{EpiNow2}](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/))

* Nowcasting and forecasting epidemiological counts that are biased by
delays in reporting ([{epinowcast}](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/)). 

üë®‚Äçüíº: Conduct research on infectious disease modelling (see Research tab).

üïê: I previously co-maintained the Carpentries course on [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson). 

## How we can work together

I am interested in working with you on a mathematical or statistical method/model that improves how we do outbreak analytics.

We can also discuss how to generalise it into a piece of software.

Please get in touch through any of my linked contacts (icons on top right). I'm basically everywhere and tend to answer promptly.
