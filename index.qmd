Hi there, I am a Research Software Engineer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics.

I am mainly interested in developing models and methods and
accompanying software to improve our understanding of how interventions impact disease
spread.

## What I do

üë®‚Äçüíº: Develop and maintain R packages for modelling infectious disease
outbreaks, including:

* Simulating and analysing transmission chains ([{bpmodels}](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/bpmodels/), [{epichains}](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/)),

* Estimating the time-varying reproduction number, growth rate, and real-time epidemiological counts ([{EpiNow2}](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/))

* Nowcasting and forecasting epidemiological counts that are biased by
delays in reporting ([{epinowcast}](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/)). 

üïê: Co-maintain the Carpentries course on [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson). 

## Research Interests

I have a PhD with a specialisation in outbreak response modelling and decision-making.
I am interested in the development of models and methods to evaluate the impact
of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of infectious vaccine-preventable diseases. However, more broadly, I am interested in
quantitative research that improves the health outcomes. 

Additionally, I like contributing to and indulging in the literature on how
to improve science, including science communication and science policy.

## Continuing Professional Development

üìñ: Reading [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html).

üñ•: Learning how to apply Bayesian data analysis to infectious disease nowcasting and forecasting through the [Statistical Rethinking book](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus).

## Collaborations

I am interested in working with you on a mathematical or statistical method/model
that improves how we do outbreak analytics.

We can also discuss how to generalise it
into a piece of software.

Please get in touch through any of my linked contacts.
I'm basically everywhere and tend to answer promptly.
