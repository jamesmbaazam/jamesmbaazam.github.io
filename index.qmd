Hi there, I am a Research Fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, based at the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases), where I work with [Dr. Kathleen O'Reilly](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/oreilly.kathleen) on:

* **Analyzing the utility of wastewater surveillance** for routine monitoring of infectious diseases in South Africa

* **Developing mathematical and statistical models** to predict the risk of polio outbreaks in Africa

Previously, I was a [Research Software Engineer](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01516-2) with the [Epiverse-TRACE Initiative](https://github.com/epiverse-trace), developing and maintaining R packages for reproducible analytics during epidemics.

I am passionate about developing models, methods, and software that improve our understanding of disease transmission and enhance outbreak response.
