The following are open-source projects that I lead or contribute to:

* [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains): a successor of [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an R package
for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains.

* [EpiNow2](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2): An R package to estimate
the time-varying reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time using a
range of open-source tools and best practices.

* [epinowcast](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast): An R package
that provides flexible and efficient methods to gain situational awareness during
outbreaks using currently available epidemiological observations and the reporting patterns of historical observations.

* [Epiverse Initiative](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/): An initiative that
aims provide an integrated, generalisable, and scalable community-driven software
ecosystem for outbreak analytics.
