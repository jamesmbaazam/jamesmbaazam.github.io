I don't currently teach as part of my duties but I can teach the following
topics quite comfortably:

* R programming from the basics to advanced topics (R package development, object-oriented programming)

* Git/GitHub from the basics to intermediate/advanced (merging and rebasing, cherry-picking, etc)

* Reproducible data analysis workflows

* Various topics in mathematical/statistical/dynamical modelling of infectious diseases

* Various topics in data analysis

* Thesis and journal article writing techniques

In the past, I've taught the following courses:

* A shortcourse on [Introduction to R: Management, Exploration, and Communication
of Data](https://www.sacema.org/opportunities/short-courses/) at the DSI-NRF
Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) at
Stellenbosch University in South Africa.

* I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2T5okssLdyVrMWHG1BBZnw) with
over 3000 subscribers with videos like
[this tutorial on Mendeley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWz8yrxNB74)
amassing over 35, 000 views.
