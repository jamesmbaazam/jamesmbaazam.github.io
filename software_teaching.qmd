Below is a summary of my open source contributions. Find my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam).

I also review open-source R code and packages for journals like the [**Journal of Open Source Software**](https://joss.theoj.org/).

Do reach out if you need my services.

I lead and contribute to several open-source communities developing R packages for outbreak analytics. You can explore all my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam).

### [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/)

During my time as a Research Software Engineer with the Epiverse-TRACE Initiative, I:

* Developed [**epichains**](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) as a successor of [**bpmodels**](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels) for analyzing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains

* Co-maintained [**EpiNow2**](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2) for estimating the time-varying reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time using Bayesian methods

### [epiforecasts community](https://github.com/epiforecasts)

I contribute to:

* [**EpiNow2**](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2): Estimates the time-varying reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time using a range of open-source tools and Bayesian methods

* [**scoringutils**](https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils): Tools for scoring and assessing predictions

### [epinowcast community](https://github.com/epinowcast)

I contribute to:

* [**epinowcast**](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast): Provides flexible and efficient methods for gaining situational awareness during outbreaks using currently available epidemiological observations and the reporting patterns of historical observations

### [The Carpentries](https://github.com/carpentries)

I briefly co-maintained the Carpentries course on [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson)

## Teaching & Outreach

### Current Teaching

I am the **lead facilitator** for the Modelling for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (MPPR) modular shortcourse hosted by [The German-West African Centre for Global Health and Pandemic Prevention (G-WAC)](https://g-wac.org/) at the College of Health Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana.

**Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes:**

At the end of the course, participants are expected to:

* Understand the concepts of infectious disease transmission and control
* Enhance knowledge about data sources, data access, and data curation in (West) Africa
* Design, implement and use context-specific mathematical models using the R programming language
* Improve knowledge of communication about modeling output
* Become part of a network of disease modelers with an interest in West Africa

We have successfully delivered two iterations of this course in 2024 and 2025.

I also maintain a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2T5okssLdyVrMWHG1BBZnw) with over 3,500 subscribers, featuring tutorials like [this Mendeley tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWz8yrxNB74) with over 36,000 views.

### Teaching Competencies

* **Mathematical/statistical/dynamical modeling** of infectious diseases
  - Introduction to Compartmental Models including methods for estimating the basic reproduction number. See example [materials](https://jamesmbaazam.github.io/intro-to-idd-modelling/).
  - Model fitting techniques. See example [materials](https://jamesmbaazam.github.io/mppr_intro_to_model_fitting/#/title-slide).
  - Basics of branching process models for infectious disease modelling
  - Introduction to Bayesian Models for Infectious Disease Forecasting
  - Developing generative Bayesian models for forecasting infectious diseases
  - Forecast evaluation using metrics such as Proper Scoring Rules

* **Reproducible data analysis workflows**
  - **R programming** from the basics to advanced topics (package development, object-oriented programming)
  - Research software/code development best practices
  - Git/GitHub from the basics to intermediate/advanced (merging and rebasing, cherry-picking, etc.)
  - R package development using software engineering industry standards
  - Pipeline orchestration with [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and the [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) R package
  - Reproducible environments and research code portability ([docker](https://www.docker.com/), [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), etc)

* **Evidence synthesis**
  - Systematic/scoping review methods and free automation tools like Rayyan. See my [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyybhi4iL_M&list=PL_JK9Yk5mzB5sz8TIqv8dat5pf-ouMeyK)

* **Thesis and journal article writing** techniques

### Previous Teaching Experience

* Short course on [Introduction to R: Management, Exploration, and Communication of Data](https://www.sacema.org/opportunities/short-courses/) at the DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) at Stellenbosch University, South Africa
