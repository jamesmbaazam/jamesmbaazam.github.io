## Current Research Focus

My current work centers on two key areas:

### Wastewater-Based Surveillance for Infectious Diseases

I am analyzing the utility of wastewater surveillance for routine monitoring of multiple infectious diseases in South Africa. This work explores how environmental surveillance can complement traditional disease monitoring systems and provide early warning signals for public health action.

### Polio Outbreak Risk Modeling

I am developing mathematical and statistical models to map polio immunity and predict the risk of polio outbreaks across Africa. This is work in early stages.

## Research Interests & Methods

I hold a PhD specializing in outbreak response modeling and decision-making. My work focuses on developing methods and open-source tools to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases.

**Key areas of expertise:**

- **Compartmental modeling** to quantify intervention impacts during epidemics
- **Real-time forecasting and nowcasting** of infections and $R_t$ using Bayesian methods with tools like [EpiNow2](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/), [epinowcast](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/), and [EpiEstim](https://mrc-ide.github.io/EpiEstim/)
- **Reproducible pipelines** and open-source packages for outbreak analytics and model implementation
- **Bayesian data analysis** for infectious disease problems
- **Software development** for epidemiological applications

## Other Ongoing Research Projects

- [Evaluating the tradeoffs of using temporally aggregated data for epidemiological forecasts](https://github.com/epiforecasts/daily-vs-weekly-forecast-eval): A case study of COVID-19 in South Africa
- [COVID-19 severity surveillance pipeline](https://github.com/SACEMA/severity-monitoring): Detecting changes in reported case fatality, case hospitalization, and hospital fatality rates
- [Two-strain variant emergence model](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/two_strain_orv_model): Studying the impact of the timing of variant emergence on control strategies
