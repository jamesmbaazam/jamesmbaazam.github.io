The EpiNow2 package provides a convenient interface to run the models, but the underlying model is a Stan model.\nThe returned fit object is either a &lt;stanfit&gt; or CmdStanModel object, depending on the backend ({rstan} or {cmdstanr}) used. For example, you can use the {bayesplot} and {posterior} packages to visualize and summarize the model diagnostics.\n\n\n\nEvaluating or assessing an {EpiNow2} model fit requires a holistic approach involving evaluating the MCMC diagnostics as well as the performance of the forecast against observed data. We will therefore proceed in that regard here.\nLet’s start by setting up and running an example model, assessing the MCMC diagnostics, and then evaluating the forecast performance."

    "text": "Assessing model diagnostics\nWe’ll first extract the Stan fit object and compute diagnostics. The epinow() function returns a list of model outputs, including the Stan fit object. This is what we need to assess the model fit. Stan provides diagnostic metrics to assess the model fit, convergence, etc. which we’ll use to assess the model fit. The Stan ecosystem has a rich set of tools for diagnosing model fit, including the bayesplot and posterior packages. These tools provide a way to visualize and summarize the model diagnostics. For an indepth look at MCMC diagnostics, for example, see the bayesplot R package vignette on visual MCMC diagnostics. You can also do posterior predictive checks using the bayesplot package.\nDiagnostics include:\n\nDivergent transitions. These should be minimized; ideally 0. Divergent transitions can be improved by tuning Stan controls like adapt_delta, max_treedepth, and stepsize in stan_opts(). If there are divergent transitions, increase adapt_delta (e.g., 0.95 or 0.99). See an in‑depth explanation at https://mc-stan.org/learn-stan/diagnostics-warnings.html.\nRhat. These should be close to 1 indicating good mixing. Rhat values should be less than 1.05 (See ?rstan::Rhat).\nTreedepth. This should be low; high values indicate potential issues with the model.\nESS values. These should be high; low values indicate insufficient sampling.

    "text": "Evaluating forecast performance\nForecast performance can be evaluated by comparing the forecast of reported cases with the observed cases using Proper Scoring Rules(Gneiting and Raftery 2007; Carvalho 2016) such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and Weighted Interval Score (WIS). These are available via the scoringutils::score() function.\nThe scoringutils::score() function requires a dataset that contains at least the following columns:\n\ndate: the date of the forecast\nprediction: forecast values\ntrue_value: the observed values\nquantile: If evaluating quantiles, the quantile of the forecasted values (e.g., median, lower and upper bounds), in ascending order.\n\nLet’s extract and prepare the forecasts and corresponding observed cases for the evaluation.\nEpiNow2’s epinow() function returns a list of model outputs in the raw and several summarised formats for various use cases. In particular, there are time series of “infections”, “reported_cases”, “growth_rate”, and “R”, all grouped into “estimate”, “estimate based on partial data”, and “forecast”.\nHere, we’re interested in the “forecast” type of the “reported_cases” variable, including the median and quantiles (lower and upper bounds).\n\n# Extract the forecasts\nforecasts &lt;- out$estimates$summarised[variable == \"reported_cases\"][type == \"forecast\", ] %&gt;% \n    select(-c(mean, sd, variable, strat, type))\n\nLet’s also extract the corresponding subset of the observed data.\n\n# Extract observed cases for the same period\nobs_data &lt;- example_confirmed[date &gt;= min(forecasts$date) & date &lt;= max(forecasts$date)]\n\nNow, let’s combine the extracted forecasts with the observed data and clean up the quantiles into a format suitable for use with scoringutils. We will be cleaning them up because the forecasts data.table labels the quantiles as lower_20, upper_20, etc., where the number indicates the quantile level (e.g., 50% for the median), but that is not compatible with scoringutils.\n\n# Combine forecasts with observed cases\neval_dt &lt;- merge(forecasts, obs_data, by = \"date\")[, true_value := confirm][, confirm := NULL]\n\n# Melt the data to long format\ncols_to_melt &lt;- c(\"median\", grep(\"^(lower|upper)_\", names(eval_dt), value = TRUE))\neval_long &lt;- melt(\n    eval_dt,\n    id.vars = setdiff(names(eval_dt), cols_to_melt),\n    measure.vars = cols_to_melt,\n    variable.name = \"prediction\",\n    value.name = \"value\"\n)\n\n# Prepare the evaluation data\neval_long[, quantile := fifelse(\n  prediction == \"median\", 0.5,\n  fifelse(\n    grepl(\"^lower_\", prediction),\n    (1 - as.numeric(sub(\"lower_\", \"\", prediction)) / 100) / 2,\n    fifelse(\n      grepl(\"^upper_\", prediction),\n      (1 + as.numeric(sub(\"upper_\", \"\", prediction)) / 100) / 2,\n      NA_real_\n    )\n  )\n)][, prediction := value][, value := NULL]\n\nWarning in fifelse(grepl(\"^lower_\", prediction), (1 - as.numeric(sub(\"lower_\",\n: NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\nWarning in fifelse(grepl(\"^upper_\", prediction), (1 + as.numeric(sub(\"upper_\",\n: NAs introduced by coercion\n\n# Sort the data by quantile\nsetorder(eval_long, quantile) %&gt;% \n    head(10)\n\n          date true_value prediction quantile\n        &lt;Date&gt;      &lt;num&gt;      &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n 1: 2020-04-22       2729    1526.00     0.05\n 2: 2020-04-23       3370    1623.90     0.05\n 3: 2020-04-24       2646    1911.95     0.05\n 4: 2020-04-25       3021    1599.00     0.05\n 5: 2020-04-26       2357    1701.95     0.05\n 6: 2020-04-27       2324    1507.00     0.05\n 7: 2020-04-28       1739    1237.85     0.05\n 8: 2020-04-22       2729    1895.00     0.25\n 9: 2020-04-23       3370    2056.75     0.25\n10: 2020-04-24       2646    2420.00     0.25\n\n\nNow we can use the scoringutils package to compute and summarise the scores.

Note that it is not difficult to interpret the scores currently as they are not relative to other models. A proper comparison can only be done against other models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing against a baseline model\n\n\n\nA common practice is to have a baseline model (Stapper and Funk 2025), such as a naive model, and compare the scores of your model against it."
