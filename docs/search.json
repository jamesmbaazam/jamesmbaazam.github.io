In a recent refactoring exercise, a colleague, Hugo Gruson pointed me to the sequence() function, which does the same job but in a terse manner.\nFor example, the following code generates a sequence of numbers from each element of a vector:\nunlist(sapply(c(1, 3, 2), function(x) seq_len(x)))\n\n[1] 1 1 2 3 1 2\nThe sequence() function is a simple function that can be used to generate sequences of numbers from each element of a vector. It provides a more concise way to generate sequences of numbers from each element of a vector while providing control over the starting and ending values of the sequence and the intervals in-between."
