    "text": "I’ve heard a lot of good things about the julia programming language over the last several years, but I’ve not bothered to learn it yet. Usually, my principle is that I only learn a new language or tool (or stack as the cool guys would call it) when I need it but not because everyone is raving about it.\nThe appealing features of julia that I hear a lot about are its computational speed (apparrently as fast as C/C++!), composability thorough multiple dispatch (wth is even that!!!), reproducibility features, and readability (easier syntax).\nThese are all attractive features that I want to harness moving forward, so a natural thing to do is to compare it to languages that I’m more familiar with.\nIn this post, I do a quick and dirty comparison of julia to R. This is not novel as others have written about it123, including the official comparison by the julia folks. However, this is my own way of learning as I go, so forgive me if none of this is new to you but I’d still love to hear your thoughts.\nIs there anything non-factual or unfair about my comparisons? Do share your thoughts below or wherever I shared this post."

This great for reproducibility and portability purposes. You can also create a Project.toml file to store information about the project.\nIn your command line, type (sequentially)\n\n]\nactivate &lt;path-to-project&gt; # take snapshot of a project\n\n\n\n\nR\nR has no inbuilt functionalities for this. You can, however, use packages such as {renv} to pin your package versions for reproducibility.\n\nif (!require(renv)) install.packages(\"renv\")\nlibrary(renv)\nrenv::activate()\n\n\n\nMy judgment\nIt’s quite clear that having to choose a package that works for you with minimal cognitive load is quite daunting for a new/intermediate user of R. Moreover, you also have to worry about the version of the package used for taking the snapshot itself. All these make it a little less desirable. Julia’s inbuilt features for snapshoting a project make it more desirable for conducting reproducible research."
